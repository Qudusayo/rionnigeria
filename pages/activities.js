                We have been able to write a number of books from the experience

                Allah, His Prophet, religion and blessed life towards attaining
                salvation. And we have used the same knowledge and wisdom to
                answer few publications of the critics of Islam. The books are
                for sales to individuals but are given freely to organizations
                for their library upkeep on request.
